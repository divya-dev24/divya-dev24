### 📂 My First Project – [HealSpace](https://github.com/divya-dev24/HealSpace)

**HealSpace** is a beginner-friendly Android app built using XML and Kotlin in Android Studio.  
The idea behind it was to create a simple self-care space with features like journaling and mood tracking.  
It was my first real hands-on project and helped me get comfortable with building UI layouts.
